# Computational Analytics Scripts

This repository contains guided Python notebooks from the Computational Analytics coursework. These scripts cover foundational concepts and methodologies for data analysis, including:

1. Base Modeling (Script 01 - Base Modeling - Guided.ipynb):

Introduces base-level modeling techniques and establishes fundamental data analysis workflows.

2. Missing Value Analysis and Transformations (Script 02 - Missing Value Analysis and Transformations - Guided.ipynb):

Focuses on handling missing data, applying transformations, and preparing datasets for advanced analysis.

These notebooks serve as an excellent starting point for understanding essential computational analytics techniques. Suitable for beginners and intermediate-level practitioners in data science and analytics.
